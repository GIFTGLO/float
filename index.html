    <h1>ROSES</h1>
    <p>A rose is a plant that is a member of the genus Rosa, which consists of some 100 species of perennial shrubs in the rose
    family. Many roses are cultivated for their beautiful flowers, which range in colour from white through various tones of
    yellow and pink to dark crimson and maroon</p>

    According to the Guinness Book of World Records, roses are the oldest species of plant to be grown as decoration. The
    rose (genus Rosa, family Rosaceae) is the oldest species of plant cultivated and used for decorative purposes. Documents
    dated to AD 50 suggest that ancient Romans grew the flowers in vast plantations and local hothouses to ensure a
    year-round supply of medicinal extracts, cooking ingredients and ornamentation. Ancient Romans used roses to decorate
    buildings, furniture and people, whilst petals were laid to create rose carpets and walkways.
